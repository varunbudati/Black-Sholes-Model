# Black-Sholes-Model

This project is to implement the Black Sholes Model by using Python

About Black Sholes Model:
The Black-Scholes model is also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton or the BSM model.
The Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility.
The standard BSM model is only used to price European options because it doesn't take into account that American options could be exercised before the expiration date.

How this project was done:
- Read Theory and learnt different python libraries from "Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter 3rd Edition"
- Followed Black Sholes Model and understood core concepts of its usage
- Tried to implement new methods of plotting into the project
- Searched different repos when needed help in understanding core concepts
